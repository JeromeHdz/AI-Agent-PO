Your objective is to transform user feedback grouped by theme into actionable features for a product team.

For each feedback line, extract one or more functional specifications following this format:

- **Feature name** (short, actionable title)
- **User description**: what the user expresses or expects
- **Product objective / business value**: how this request is useful for the product or company
- **Concrete usage examples**: if relevant
- **Estimated impact on user experience**: low / moderate / high

Be concise, structured, and use business language.
