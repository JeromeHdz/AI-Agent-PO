**Justification**: Justification: The "Must" features are critical due to their high impact on user experience and business value. Stability and performance are foundational for user retention, while improved search, security, integration, and UI enhancements directly address frequent user needs and significantly enhance usability. Task and project management features, along with reliability for large teams, are essential for maintaining competitiveness. The "Should" features, like advanced customization and reporting, provide substantial business value and user satisfaction but are not as urgent. "Could" features, such as export functionality and notification improvements, offer moderate impact and can be prioritized later.
